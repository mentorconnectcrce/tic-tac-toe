# Tic Tac Toe - Dynamic Symbol System

## Game Mechanics

This Tic Tac Toe game now features a **dynamic symbol system with a deque of 10 hidden blocks**.

### How It Works

1. **10 Random Blocks**: At the start of each game, 10 random blocks are generated (each either X or O)

2. **Hidden Deque**: All blocks start face-down and are displayed below the game board

3. **Alternating Reveal Pattern**: 
   - Turn 1: Reveal from **front** (index 0)
   - Turn 2: Reveal from **back** (index 9)
   - Turn 3: Reveal from **front** (index 1)
   - Turn 4: Reveal from **back** (index 8)
   - And so on...

4. **Symbol Placement**: The revealed block determines which symbol (X or O) the current player MUST place on the board for that turn

5. **Both Players Can Play Same Symbol**: Since blocks are random, Player 1 might play X on turn 1, then O on turn 3, while Player 2 might play O on turn 2, then X on turn 4

6. **Win Condition**: After every move, the game checks if the placed symbol completes 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). The player who placed that winning symbol wins, regardless of whether it was X or O

## Game Mechanics

This Tic Tac Toe game now features a **dynamic symbol system with a deque of 10 hidden blocks** and an **interactive reveal mechanism**.

### How It Works

1. **10 Random Blocks**: At the start of each game, 10 random blocks are generated (each either X or O)

2. **Hidden Deque**: All blocks start face-down (shown as "?") and are displayed below the game board

3. **Interactive Block Reveal**: 
   - Players must **click on a hidden block** to reveal it
   - Turn 1: Must click the **FIRST** block (leftmost hidden block)
   - Turn 2: Must click the **LAST** block (rightmost hidden block)
   - Turn 3: Must click the **FIRST** block again
   - Turn 4: Must click the **LAST** block again
   - Pattern continues: Front → Back → Front → Back...
   - The correct block glows and pulses to guide the player

4. **Two-Step Turn Process**:
   - **Step 1**: Click the glowing hidden block to reveal it
   - **Step 2**: Place the revealed symbol (X or O) on any empty square on the board

5. **Symbol Placement**: The revealed block determines which symbol (X or O) the current player MUST place on the board for that turn

6. **Both Players Can Play Same Symbol**: Since blocks are random, Player 1 might play X on turn 1, then O on turn 3, while Player 2 might play O on turn 2, then X on turn 4

7. **Win Condition**: After every move, the game checks if the placed symbol completes 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). The player who placed that winning symbol wins, regardless of whether it was X or O

8. **Draw Condition**: If all 10 blocks are revealed and used, and the board is full with no winner, the game ends in a draw
